# Friend-Finder
A dating-app esque Node express application
## Overview
 build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing.
I used Ok Cupid's most answered quesitions to get the 10 survey questions. <https://theblog.okcupid.com/the-most-important-questions-on-okcupid-32e80bad0854>
